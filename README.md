# Twingly Search API PHP

[![GitHub Build Status](https://github.com/twingly/twingly-search-api-php/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/twingly/twingly-search-api-php/actions)

A PHP library for Twingly's Search API (previously known as Analytics API). Twingly is a blog search service that provides a searchable API known as [Twingly Search API](https://developer.twingly.com/resources/search/).

## Installation

Install via Composer

```shell
php composer.phar require twingly/twingly-search

# Or if you have installed composer globally
composer require twingly/twingly-search
```

## Usage

```php
use Twingly\Client;

$client = new Client();

$query = $client->query();
$query->search_query = 'github page-size:10 lang:sv';
$result = $query->execute();

foreach($result->posts as $post) {
    echo $post->url . "\n";
}
```

The `twingly-search` library talks to a commercial blog search API and requires an API key. Best practice is to set the `TWINGLY_SEARCH_KEY` environment variable to the obtained key. `\Twingly\Client` can be passed a key at initialization if your setup does not allow environment variables.

This library is documented with [phpdoc](http://www.phpdoc.org/). To generate documentation call

```shell
phpdoc -d ./src -t ./docs
```

Example code can be found in [examples/](examples/).

To learn more about the capabilities of the API, please read the [Twingly Search API documentation](https://developer.twingly.com/resources/search/).
